Cerebral Palsy Comprehension Machine Learning
This repository contains the source code and related resources for a machine learning project aimed at improving comprehension for individuals with Cerebral Palsy.

Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person's ability to move and maintain balance and posture. CP is the most common motor disability in childhood. In many cases, people with CP have difficulty with speech and language comprehension. This project aims to use machine learning techniques to enhance comprehension for those individuals, making communication easier and more effective.
